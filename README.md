This project aims to combine TF-IDF model with Senti-model which I proposed. Since TF-IDF model contains the information of the importance of words, and Senti-model represents emotional information using sentiment dictionary.

  - Dataset : ChnSentiCorp
  - Preprocessing
  - Lookup table
  - TF-IDF
  - Classifier : MLP
